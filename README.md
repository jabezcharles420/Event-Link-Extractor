# Event-Link-Extractor
This n8n workflow automates the extraction and enrichment of event data. It reads event URLs from a Google Sheet, scrapes each URL, uses a two-stage AI process (first extraction, then web search) to fill in detailed event information, and finally saves the complete data to a separate Google Sheet.
